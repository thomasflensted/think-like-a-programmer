# Think Like A Porgrammer

Think Like A Programmer is a book by V. Anton Spraul. It has chapters on different types of problems and different ways of solving them. I intend to go through the book and solve all of the problems. I will be using C++ to solve the problems.

## Chapter 1: Strategies for Problem Solving (no programming)

1. Always have a plan: Don't just start writing code. Plan it out as much as possible.
2. Restate the problem in my/your own words. 
3. Divide the problem: Divide the problem into smaller problems and solve them one by one.
4. Start with what you know: Use the tools and techniques you already have before jumping into unknown territory.
5. Reduce the problem: Add or remove constraints so the problem becomes simpler and solvable. Then work toward solving the original problem.
6. Look for analogies.
7. Experiment to make sure you understand code/libraries you're using.
